# nashville-housing-data-cleaning

Using SQL to clean data. Data from AlexTheAnalyt's GitHub: <https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx>.

Included in this repository are the SQL file I created and the CSV file I used.

Skills used:
- Utilised SQL Server to extract and clean raw data to enable comprehensive analysis of Nashville housing trends.
- Standardised data types using ALTER TABLE and ALTER COLUMN.
- Populated columns with null values using a self-join.
- Separated columns by delimiter using SUBSTRING and PARSENAME.
